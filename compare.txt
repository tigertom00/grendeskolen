1. General Observations
The documents are largely similar in structure and sectioning.
They both cover the same project (Haugen Skole, +01=434.004), but Rev. 09 introduces some key changes and updates.
2. Title Block and Project Details (First Page)
Changes:
Rev.08: “GK BA - 434 004 0808”
Rev.09: “GK BA - 434 004 0909”
The revision number is updated to "0909" in Rev.09.
In the list of component/system numbers and codes, Rev.09 includes:
More frequent use of “KR31371” (uppercase) and “KR31371 21006013”.
Some ordering or duplication differences in the system numbers.
The revision log at the bottom of page 1 in Rev.09 includes different or additional dates:
“16.06.25” is now referenced as a revision date.
The text “Flyttet bryter s. 52 til tavle +01=434.005” appears in revision logs for Rev.09.
3. Revision Table & Updates (Page 2+)
Changes:
Rev.09 lists the following new or changed revision information:
“Flyttet bryter s. 52 til tavle +01=434.005”
“16.06.25” is used as a revision date.
The revision number and corresponding codes are updated from “03” to “09”.
The sequence and content of the revision comments are slightly altered to reflect new changes.
4. Notable New Content (Unique to Rev. 09)
NEW! On Page 25 (and highlighted):

Code
Rev. 09
Termiske energimålere
har fått nye komponentnummer.
Nye anleggnummer for radiator-, 
gulvvarme- og forvarmekurser
This block is not present in Rev. 08.

What does this mean?
Thermal energy meters have new component numbers.
New plant numbers for radiator, floor heating, and preheating circuits.
This is a significant update indicating renumbering and restructuring of system components.

5. Minor Changes
Various codes and numbering (e.g., “KR31371”, capitalization) are updated, and some numbers appear more often or in new locations.
The revision number (Rev.) is consistently updated from “03”/“0808” to “09”/“0909” throughout all headers and footers.
The revision log reflects the new revision cycle and new changes.
6. No Change/Repeating Content
Most of the technical content, table structure, and section headers remain unchanged.
The structure and numbering of pages, tables, and references are highly consistent outside the revision updates.
7. Summary Table

Major New Note	-	Rev. 09: Termiske energimålere har fått nye komponentnummer...
Revision Details	No mention of moving switch or component renumbering	Flyttet bryter s. 52 til tavle +01=434.005, new component and plant numbers
Codes	“kr31371” used, not as frequent or uppercase	“KR31371” used more and in uppercase
Conclusion: Key Differences
Rev. 09 introduces new component and plant numbering for thermal energy meters, radiator, floor heating, and preheating circuits.
A switch on page 52 has been moved to the panel +01=434.005 (noted in revision log).
Revision numbers, dates, and certain codes have been updated to reflect the new revision.
No major structural or technical changes apart from the above.
